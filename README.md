<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I was playing some Roblox in the summer, namely this game called doodle world. The game itself is pretty grindy, and they had a summer event that was essentially to do tasks to get some in-game currency. 
These tasks were extremely repetitive and I got a little bored doing them so I made a bot instead. 
This was a fun experience because I had played this game when I was younger and had always had this idea of making a bot but never really felt motivated enough to do it.

The bot makes roughly 500 of said currency per hour which is decent (I think) to the average human rate, and does one of the two implementable tasks a lot better than I could.
